Marvin transfer
===============
A command line utility for easy file and folder transfer between local computer and android device  

![Marvin demo](marvin-demo.gif)  

Especially on mac transferring files to an android device can be a hassle. The Android File Transfer app is completely useless and setting up a mtp fuse can be unstable. That's why Marvin transfer exist, to ease the pain.  

## Install
### Requirements
* Recommended **Python 3.3 or higher** for full character support (utf-8)
* Also works with **Python 2.7** but only with basic ascii support, future support is not guaranteed
* This utility uses the **ADB (Android Device Bridge)** as a backend and therefor it must be installed and adb must exist in the $PATH  

*(Tested on python3.5/3.3/2.7 on OSX 10.9 with Nexus 5/9 on Android Marshmallow)*


### Clone repository
Clone or download the repository

    git clone https://github.com/f95johansson/marvin-transfer.git

Then you can **try it out** by simply 

    cd marvin-transfer
    python3 marvin.py

**Install** it using python3

    cd marvin-transfer
    pip3 install .

Use `pip` instead of `pip3` if using python2.7

After system wide install, start the application anywhere with

    marvin

### Uninstall
I you decide that you want to uninstall it *(if you installed it with pip3)*

    pip3 uninstall marvin-transfer

Again, `pip` instead of `pip3` if using python2.7



## Usage
The ui consist of two columns, the left one your local computers file system, the right you connected android device's system

* use **arrow keys** to navigate (right/left to enter/exit folders)
* **enter** to transfer currently selected file/foder
* **tab/space** to change focus between local computer and android device
* **escape/ctrl-c** to exit program
* typing letters works as a filter on the current directory, for faster navigation
